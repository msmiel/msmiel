### Hi there 👋

My name is Mavreen and I'm a Senior SDET. 

My mom said I'd never make any money breaking things. I'm really glad she was wrong this once.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making tools to test data quality at scale and working in thoughtful ML. I particularly like applying this work to Trust and Safety.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my Security+ Certification.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an advid scuba diver!
