### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Mavreen and I'm a Senior SDET. 

My mom said I'd never make any money breaking things. I'm really glad she was wrong this once.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making tools to test data quality at scale and working in thoughtful ML. I particularly like applying this work to Trust and Safety.
- ğŸŒ± Currently learning C#.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
