### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Mavreen and I'm a Senior SDET. 

My mom said I'd never make any money breaking things. I'm really glad she was wrong this once.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on all things performance and observability. 
- ğŸŒ± Currently tinkering on some CLI tools in Go.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an advid scuba diver!
